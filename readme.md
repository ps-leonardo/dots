# dots 
This is my personal set of dotfiles built around **Arch Linux** and **Hyprland**

- üêü **Fish shell**
- üê± **Kitty terminal**
- ü™ü **Hyprland** Wayland compositor
- üåà **Wallust** for dynamic theming
- üîß Custom configurations and keybindings

These dotfiles help me quickly set up a beautiful, efficient, and keyboard-driven Linux desktop.
